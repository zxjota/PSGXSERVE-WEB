    <h1>PSGXSERVE — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="minor">Effective date: <strong>November 23, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>PSGXSERVE</strong> (the "App"). Your privacy matters to us. This Privacy Policy explains how PSGXSERVE ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you use the App and related services (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Information You Provide</h3>
    <p>We may collect information you voluntarily provide, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account data:</strong> email address, display name, and password if you create an account.</li>
      <li><strong>Study records:</strong> learning progress, study notes, logged errors/mistakes, timestamps, attachments (e.g., images or files you upload), tags, and custom labels.</li>
      <li><strong>Support communications:</strong> any messages, feedback, or other correspondence you send to us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <p>When you use the Service, we may automatically collect certain technical and usage information, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> screens visited, features used, session duration, and interaction events.</li>
      <li><strong>Device data:</strong> device model, operating system and version, app version, and unique device identifiers.</li>
      <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> crash reports, error logs, and performance metrics to help us improve the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Local-First & Offline Data</h3>
    <p>PSGXSERVE is designed with a privacy-first approach. Unless you explicitly enable cloud sync or account-based backups, your study data (progress logs, error records, notes, and attachments) is stored locally on your device. Local storage means we do not receive or store your study content on our servers by default. If you enable any optional sync or backup features, those features are described separately and will require your explicit consent.</p>

    <h3>1.4 Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3>
    <p>We and our service providers may use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies to enable App functionality, remember preferences, and collect analytics. You can control these settings through your device or browser, but disabling some technologies may impact functionality.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use collected information for purposes including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing, operating, and maintaining the App;</li>
      <li>Saving and retrieving your study progress and error logs;</li>
      <li>Personalizing and improving your learning experience (suggestions, reminders, visualizations);</li>
      <li>Responding to support requests and communications;</li>
      <li>Diagnosing technical issues, improving performance, and preventing abuse;</li>
      <li>Complying with legal obligations and enforcing our terms of service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Information Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or trade your personal information. We may disclose information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> third-party vendors who perform services on our behalf (e.g., hosting, analytics, crash reporting). These providers only access data necessary to perform their duties and are contractually bound to protect your data.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal compliance:</strong> when required by law, regulation, or legal process, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of PSGXSERVE, its users, or others.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> in connection with a merger, sale, reorganization, or acquisition, subject to confidentiality protections.</li>
      <li><strong>User-initiated sharing:</strong> when you explicitly request or authorize sharing (for example, exporting study data or connecting to a third-party backup or learning service).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Policy, to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. If you delete your account (where applicable) or uninstall the App, locally stored data will be removed from your device; server-side retention (if any) will be handled according to any optional sync/backup settings you have enabled.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>We follow industry-standard practices to protect the information we process, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data. If we become aware of a data breach affecting personal information, we will comply with applicable notification requirements.</p>

    <h2>6. Analytics & Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>To understand and improve the App, we may use third-party analytics and diagnostics services (for example, Firebase, Google Analytics for Firebase, or similar). These services may collect device-level and usage data. We do not use collected personal study content for advertising purposes. Review the privacy policies of these third parties for details and any available opt-out mechanisms.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Choices & Rights</h2>
    <p>Subject to applicable law, you may have rights regarding your personal information, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access:</strong> request a copy of the personal data we hold about you;</li>
      <li><strong>Correction:</strong> request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data;</li>
      <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> request deletion of personal data (subject to legal exceptions);</li>
      <li><strong>Portability:</strong> request a machine-readable copy of the data you provided;</li>
      <li><strong>Restriction/Objection:</strong> request restriction of processing or object to certain uses;</li>
      <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> opt out of promotional communications at any time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, contact us using the details in the "Contact Us" section below. We may require verification of identity before processing certain requests.</p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe your child under 13 has provided personal information to us, please contact us so we can take steps to delete the information promptly.</p>

    <h2>9. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be stored and processed in countries other than your country of residence. Where data is transferred across borders, we take steps to ensure it is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy and applicable law (for example, using contractual safeguards where required).</p>

    <h2>10. California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
    <p>If you are a California resident, you may have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), including the right to request access to and deletion of certain personal information we hold. To make a request, see the "Contact Us" section below. We will respond in accordance with applicable laws.</p>

    <h2>11. GDPR and EEA Residents</h2>
    <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the lawful bases for processing personal data may include your consent, performance of a contract, compliance with legal obligations, or our legitimate interests. You have rights under the GDPR, including access, correction, deletion, portability, and objection. Contact us to exercise these rights.</p>

    <h2>12. Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>The App may contain links to third-party websites, services, or integrations that are not operated by us. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those third parties. We encourage you to review the privacy notices of any third-party services before providing your personal data.</p>

    <h2>13. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will post a notice within the App or provide other notice as required by law and update the "Effective date" above. Continued use of the App after changes indicates your acceptance of the updated Policy.</p>
